For a single compromised device, this checking pocess (assuming it is carried out by the voter using a different, uncompromised device) detects this attack, though only if the voter carries it out. For large scale attacks that compromise multiple devices, the ballot tracking check detects this attack with high probability if enough voters carry it out using uncompromised devices. If this mitigation is successful, the attack may be thwarted for the voter, or becomes an attack on availability, depending on whether the voter has a recourse to correct  their submission. If the voter has a correcting recourse, the attack is thwarted for that voter.  If the voter's recourse is restricted to reporting and canceling the ballot, the attack is on {A1}. Finally, if a procedure is in place whereby an election outcome is invalidated if a sufficient number of voters make reports of mismatched ciphertexts, the attack is additionally on {A3}.
