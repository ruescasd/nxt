#
# This model defines a threat model for the Tusk Voting System
# End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting system.

# Any *threat model* includes:
#  - a *description of the system under threat* (this is found in our
#    systems engineering specification written in SysML),
#  - the desired *properties* of a system (which are derived from the
#    *requirements* imposed upon the system),
#  - the *adversaries* of the system (@todo kiniry to where these are
#    characterized),
#  - the potential *attacks* from the adversaries,
#  - the *contexts* of attacks,
#  - the *mitigations* used to stop or blunt attacks, be they
#    technical, procedural, or operational.
#
# This current semi-formal threat model only includes properties,
# attacks, mitigations, and contexts.  See Issue #TBD for a
# description of missing features.

# ========================================================================
# Properties: desirable properties of the system. They are a bridge
# between security objectives and e-voting literature properties.
#
#   Properties form a hierarchy.
#
# Attacks: ways to undermine or negate Properties.
#
#   Attacks form a hierarchy both for composition* and instantiation,
#   though neither of these is used in complex ways. Attacks refer to
#   themselves and all other elements, Properties, Mitigations and
#   Contexts.  (* Technically, attack composition supports graphs, but
#   this is almost never used.)
#
# Mitigations: methods to prevent an attack, or lessen its impact.
#
#   Mitigations are a flat structure.
#
# Contexts: a loose notion of "where" an attack is carried out.
#
#   Contexts are a flat structure.
#
# Features not supported by this model:
#
# * Parent child relationships between mitigations
# * Explicit abstract mitigations (besides mitigations that apply to
#   abstract attacks)
# * Freely selecting AND vs OR compositions for parent child
#   relationships.
# * Distinguishing between mitigations that aim to prevent an attack vs
#   those aimed at lessening its impact.
# * Contexts as a general classification mechanism. Contexts only
#   serve to materialize ("locate") the instantiation of abstract attacks.
# * Attacks that target mitigations
#

# In all text strings (descriptions, rationales, names, etc.),
# links (which will be converted to hyperlinks in LaTeX) can be
# written as follows:
# {X}:      link to the property, mitigation, attack, or context
#           with identifier X
# {[X]}:    cite the bibliographic reference with key X
# {[X][Y]}: link to anchor X with link text Y


# Properties are desirable characteristics of the system. They correspond
# to properties in the e-voting domain and security objectives in the
# threat modeling domain.
#
# Parent child relationships are AND compositions: in order for a
# Property to be satisified, all its descendants must be satisfied.

properties:
  CONFIDENTIALITY:
    - The e-voting properties of Privacy, Everlasting privacy, Receipt-freeness, and
      Coercion-resistance are mapped to this security objective.
    - P1:
        - It must not be possible to link a voter to their vote.
        - P1.1: The only information on voter selections leaked by the voter application
            is the computed cryptogram.
          P1.2: It must not be possible for anyone to decrypt cryptograms in the absence
            of a threshold of trustees.
          P1.3: It must not be possible for anyone to determine the complete mixing permutations
            or randomization factors.
          P1.4: The decryption process must only operate on cryptograms output from the
            mixing process.
      P2: It must not be possible for future computationally unbounded adversaries to link a voter
            to their vote using published data from past elections.
      P3:
        - It must not be possible for a voter to prove how they voted.
        - P3.1: A voter does not gain a receipt that can be used to prove to anyone else
            that they voted in a certain way.
          P3.2: A voter cannot cooperate with a coercer to prove that they voted in a
            certain way.
  INTEGRITY:
    - The e-voting properties of Accuracy, Eligibility, Fairness, Verifiability, and
      Dispute-freeness are mapped to this security objective.
    - CORRECTNESS:
      - Correctness is the sum of Accuracy + Eligibility + Fairness.
      - C1:
          - Votes are cast correctly.
          - C1.1: Each cryptogram cast by the {VA} is an encryption of data that accurately
              represents the voter's intent.
        C2:
          - Cast votes are correctly recorded.
          - C2.1: Each cryptogram recorded in the {BB} is identical to a cryptogram cast
              by the {VA}.
        C3:
          - Recorded votes are correctly counted.
          - C3.1:
              - The set of cryptograms input to the mixing process is correct.
              - C3.1.1: Each cryptogram input to the mixing process must match one-to-one
                  with an eligible voter.
                C3.1.2: Each cryptogram input to the mixing process must match one-to-one
                  with a cryptogram recorded in the ballot box.
            C3.2: The set of cryptograms output by the mixing process must match one-to-one
              with the input set of cryptograms, such that each output cryptogram is an
              equivalent encryption of its matching input cryptogram.
            C3.3: The set of cryptograms input to the decryption process is identical
              to the output of the mixing process.
            C3.4:
              - Each plaintext output by the decryption process must have been decrypted
                correctly.
              - C3.4.1: Each partial decryption of every cryptogram must have been computed
                  correctly.
                C3.4.2: Each plaintext for every cryptogram must have been computed correctly
                  from its partial decryptions.
            C3.5:
              - The election outcome is correctly computed.
              - C3.5.1: The input to the tabulation algorithm is identical to the output
                  of the decryption process.
                C3.5.2: The tabulation algorithm is correctly applied.
            C3.6: The set of printed ballots must match one-to-one with the decrypted
              plaintext outputs.
            C3.7: The mixing, decryption, tabulation, and printing processes cannot begin
              until the election period is over and all cryptograms have been collected
              in the ballot box.
      VERIFIABILITY:
        - Verifiability refers to the ability to verify that {Correctness} properties
          hold.
        - V1:
            - Cast-as-intended verifiability
            - V1.1: Voters must be able to verify {C1.1} for their cryptograms.
          V2:
            - Recorded-as-cast verifiability
            - V2.1: Voters must be able to verify {C2.1} for their cryptograms.
          V3:
            - Counted-as-recorded verifiability
            - V3.1: Anyone must be able to verify {C3.1.2}, {C3.2}, {C3.3}, {C3.4}, and
                {C3.5}.
          V4:
            - Eligibility verifiability
            - V4.1: Anyone must be able to verify {C3.1.1}.
          V5:
            - Software independence
            - V5.1: An (undetected) change or error in the software cannot cause an undetectable
                change or error in an election outcome.
      DISPUTE_FREENESS:
        - In general, dispute-freeness refers to the existence of mechanisms
          to resolve disputes that may arise during the electoral process.
          Here, we restrict dispute-freeness to resolving three types of disputes, which
          yield child properties {D1}, {D2}, and {D3}. For brevity, we describe these properties
          as the disputes that must be resolved, but strictly speaking these properties
          refer to the ability to resolve said disputes.
        - D1: A voter claims to have cast a ballot $b$, while the election
              authority claims that they did not cast $b$.
          D2: A voter claims to have not cast a ballot $b$, while the
              election authority claims that they did cast $b$.
          D3: A voter claims that their device is producing incorrect
              cryptograms, while the election authority is unable to
              verify this claim.
  AVAILABILITY:
    - The e-voting properties of {Robustness} and {Scalability} are
      mapped to this security objective.
    - A1: Every voter must be able to cast their vote ({C1}, {C2}) such
          that their participation is not denied or hampered.
      A2: All participants must be able to perform applicable
          verification operations ({V1}, {V2}, {V3}, {V4}) such that
          verifiability is not denied or hampered.
      A3: The election outcome must be computed in a timely fashion.
      A4: The election public key must be computed in a timely fashion.

          cloud provider is malicious.
      mitigations:
        -
          - Out of scope
          - A malicious cloud provider has access to the underlying hardware and therefore
            has full control of subsystems executing within.
    -

        kind: A
        name: Virtualization attack
        description: One or more subsystems execute in a cloud environment where other

      mitigations:
        -
          - Cybersecurity---Virtualization
          - General cybersecurity practices aimed to prevent against

        - Formal verification provides assurance that the source code satisfies its
          specification.

      description: The implementation within a software dependency is insecure and
        is exploited.
    mitigations:
      -
        - Dependency minimization
        - Minimizing the number and size of dependencies reduces the likelihood of
          insecure dependencies impacting system security.
      -

        protocol communications.
    mitigations:
      -
        - Message signatures

-
  _:
    kind: A
    name: Corruption
    description: One or more subsystems or actors behaves maliciously.
  mitigations:
    -

      - Distributing trust among multiple subsystems and actors reduces the likelihood
        that a corrupt subsystem or actor can compromise the system's security.
    -
      - Operational redundancy
      - Redundancy in deployed implementations can reduce the likelihood that a corrupt
        subsystem or actor can compromise the system's availability.

-
  _:
    kind: A
    name: Side channel
    description: An adversary acquires sensitive information via unintended,
      indirect mechanisms (e.g., electromagnetic radiation) that arise from
      the execution of the protocol on physical machines and networks.
  mitigations:
    -
      - External audits
      - External audits to evaluate side-channel resistance of implementations can
        often rule out or quantify the severity of specific side channel risks.
-
  _:
    kind: A
    name: Phishing
    description: An adversary acquires sensitive information from a protocol
      actor via deceptive means external to the protocol.
  mitigations:
    -
      - Out of scope
      - If a protocol actor can be social engineered into revealing sufficient
        information to enable an adversary to participate as them within the
        protocol, there is no way for the system to distinguish between the
        adversary and the legitimate actor.
-
  _:
    kind: A
    name: Spoofing
    description: An adversary attacks the system by masquerading as
      a protocol subsystem or actor.
  mitigations:
    -
      - Controlled environment
      - For some parts of the system, a controlled environment can prevent
        adversaries from masquerading as protocol actors (e.g., the identities
        of trustees can be physically verified when they enter the room housing
        the {AGN}). However, much of the system is run in uncontrolled
        environments.
    -
      - Message signatures
      - Provided an adversary does not acquire the necessary signing keys (e.g.,
        through {Phishing} or {Side channel}), the use of digitally signed
        messages within the protocol can prevent spoofed messages from impacting
        system security.


### Attacks on Correctness ###

  _:
    name: Mismatched encryption
  children:
  -
    _:
      name: Cheating voting device
      properties: [C1.1]
      description: The voting application encrypts a cryptogram that does not correspond
        to the voter's intent.
      instance_of: Compromised user device
      contexts: [VA]
    mitigations:
        # Note: Mismatched encryption attacks are most effective when carried out
        # against ballots that are already _cast_ on the bulletin board. For ballots
        # that are submitted but not yet cast, the voter has a corrective recourse,
        # by submitting a new ballot.
      -
        - Cast as intended verifiability
        - The ballot checking process will detect mismatched encrypted submissions.
          For a single compromised device, this checking process (assuming it
          is carried out by the voter using a different, uncompromised device) detects
          this attack, though only if the voter carries it out. In this case, the
          voter may resubmit their ballot using an uncompromised device, thwarting
          the attack for that voter. For large scale attacks that compromise multiple devices,
          the ballot checking process detects this attack with high probability if enough voters
          carry it out using uncompromised devices. If a procedure is in place whereby an election
          outcome is invalidated if a sufficient number of voters make reports of mismatched
          ciphertexts, the attack is additionally on {A3}. See also Malicious reporting.
      -
        - Recorded as cast verifiability
        - Ballot tracker checks on the bulletin boad will detect covert submit-and-cast
          of mismatched ciphertexts. For a single compromised device, this checking pocess
          (assuming it is carried out by the voter using a different, uncompromised device)
          detects this attack, though only if the voter carries it out. For large scale attacks
          that compromise multiple devices, the ballot tracking check detects this attack with
          high probability if enough voters carry it out using uncompromised devices. If this
          mitigation is successful, the attack may be thwarted for the voter, or becomes an attack on
          availability, depending on whether the voter has a recourse to correct  their submission.
          If the voter has a correcting recourse, the attack is thwarted for that voter.  If the
          voter's recourse is restricted to reporting and canceling the ballot, the attack is on {A1}.
          Finally, if a procedure is in place whereby an election outcome is invalidated if a sufficient
          number of voters make reports of mismatched ciphertexts, the attack is additionally on {A3}.

          that observer will learn how they voted. This can be mitigated in the coercion
          case to some extent by allowing a voter to vote multiple times (across multiple
          sessions) and keep only the last one (or only a specific one, though this
          may not be possible without the use of out-of-band voting codes), in the hope

          attack can be mitigated using the same techniques that mitigate against counterfeit
          voter/ballot-checking applications generally, as the real voting/ballot-checking

        - While it is possible on some platforms to mitigate this attack with respect
          to on-device screen recording capabilities (by either disabling/restricting
          screen recording, or corrupting/obstructing screen recordings when they are

    mitigations:
      -
        - Denial of service protection
        - This attack can be mitigated by standard denial of service mitigation techniques
          typically used for Internet services. These include the deployment of protective
          services such as Akamai and Cloudflare (especially for large/high stakes elections),
          proper configuration of firewall rules on election administration networks
          and cloud-based services, and per-client rate limiting of requests to prevent
          application-level denial of service (e.g., submission of many bad protocol
          messages by corrupted clients delaying the processing of legitimate protocol

    mitigations:
      -
        - Out of scope
        - Preventing this attack is outside the system scope, as the system cannot control
          Internet infrastructure. However, it can be mitigated by geographic diversity
          of servers for elections where such diversity can be achieved (e.g., parts
          of the infrastructure in the cloud can be replicated across multiple cloud
          regions so that regional disruptions don't take down the entire system).

    mitigations:
      -
        - Out of scope
        - Preventing this attack is outside the system scope, as the system cannot control
          the Internet access capabilities of the voters. One way to mitigate this attack
          is to provide voters with Internet access at locations like public libraries,
          election offices, coffee shops, etc., that would allow them to cast their
          ballots outside their ``home'' network (which is presumably what is being
          targeted in this scenario). Another is for the voting period to be long enough
          that such a targeted DoS does not prevent the voter from accessing the voting
          system at some convenient time during the voting period.

    mitigations:
      -
        - Out of scope
        - If a sufficiently capable counterfeit application exists, and a voter is deceived
          into voting with it, it can effectively carry out any other attack on this
          list that involves a compromised voter application, though all mitigations
          against those attacks also serve as mitigations against this one. There are
          also several ways to mitigate this attack by reducing both the likelihood
          of such a counterfeit application existing and and the likelihood of such
          an application successfully deceiving voters. These include the use of trusted
          mobile application stores, high-profile announcements to voters to only trust
          applications from specific sources, and other techniques commonly used to
          validate software distributions.

      as a ballot that is identical to one cast previously. It is important to carefully
      consider when the duplicate weeding takes place, either at cast time or during
      mixnet submission. For example, detection at cast time can lead to performance
      problems, whereas postponing this to mixnet submission time can lead to disputes.

    - Data published to achieve {M4} (Eligibility verifiability) only reveals pseudonyms.
      Even if ballot encryption is compromised, its content cannot be linked to real
      identities using public information. See Haines et al.~{[[HainesEtAlSoKSecure2023]]}
      for other approaches to everlasting privacy.
    - core
  M25:
    - Operational redundancy
    - The use of redundant subsystems or actors allows individual elements to fail without
      compromising the overall operation of the system. The use of a threshold cryptographic
      system is an example of Operational redundancy, but also of {M17} (Trust distribution).
    - partially-core
  M26:
    - Denial of service protection
    - Standard denial of service protection techniques, typically offered by cloud vendors,
      are employed.
    - non-core
  M27:
    - Cybersecurity---Supply chains
    - The system deployment incorporates general cybersecurity practices aimed to protect
      against supply chain attacks, for example attestation.
    - non-core
  M28:
    - Domain separation
    - Cryptographic primitives are used in a way that ensures that they are not used
      in multiple contexts.
    - partially-core
  M29:
    - Append-only trustee board
    - Each trustee maintains a local, append-only view of the protocol board.
    - partially-core
  M30:
    - Auditable pseudonyms
    - Pseudonyms can be constructed from auditable, but private, information using
      a one way function. This allows external auditors to privately verify that the
      identities certified by the EA are in fact eligible, without revealing those
      identities to the public (note that even if these identities were revealed,
      ballots are still protected by encryption).
    - non-core
  M31:
    - Voter specific Naor-Yung proofs
    - Ballot cryptogram Naor-Yung proofs are made voter-specific, for example by
      including the voter's pseudonym or signature public key (or other voter derived
      value) in the proof challenge generation.

# Contexts are used when instantiating abstract attacks. They represent the loose
# notion of "where" the instantiated attack is carried out.
#
# Examples:
#
# The abstract attack "Corruption" has as context the actor being corrupted
# The abstract attack "Compromised device" has as context the device/subsystem being compromised
# The abstract attack "Broken cryptography" has as context the cryptographic primitive or building block that is broken
