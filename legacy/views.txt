This file shows the results of running view.py on our legacy tm.yaml threat model. First we show
the help screen for the command, and then the results for each of the commands shown as examples.
Not all examples are represented at the moment, some commands that specify a root node (-r) are not
yet included, these are:

./view.py -e outstanding -r my_attack       # prints outstanding attacks starting at 'my_attack'

❯ python view.py
usage: view.py [-h] [-d [DATABASE]] [-t] [-e {property,context,mitigation,attack,outstanding}] [-r ROOT] [-o] [-a]

Display data in table or tree format.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --database [DATABASE]
                        Path to the SQLite database file
  -t, --tree            Display data in tree format
  -e, --entity {property,context,mitigation,attack,outstanding}
                        Specify the entity to display
  -r, --root ROOT       Specify the root entity by name
  -o, --oos             Show Out of scope "mitigations", for applicable views
  -a, --abstract        Show abstract attacks, for applicable views

Examples:
    ./view.py -e property                       # prints all properties table
    ./view.py -e property -t                    # prints all properties tree
    ./view.py -e property -t -r my_property     # prints properties tree, starting at 'my_property'
    ./view.py -e attack                         # prints all attacks table
    ./view.py -e attack -t                      # prints all attacks tree
    ./view.py -e attack -r my_attack            # prints attacks table, starting at my_attack
    ./view.py -e mitigation                     # prints all mitigations table
    ./view.py -e mitigation -r my_attack        # prints mitigations table for attack 'my_attack'
    ./view.py -e mitigation -r my_attack -t     # prints mitigations tree for attack 'my_attack'
    ./view.py -e context                        # prints all contexts
    ./view.py -e outstanding                    # prints all outstanding attacks
    ./view.py -e outstanding -r my_attack       # prints outstanding attacks starting at 'my_attack'

The following two views were produced by temporarily removing (and then parsing tm.yaml) the out of scope 
mitigation from "Malicious reporting of VD":
    
    mitigations:
      -
        - Out of scope
        - Since the system does not satisfy D*-dispute-freeness, it may not be possible
          to avoid this attack except by removing election invalidation altogether.
          However, this undermines mitigation {M1} (Cast as intended verifiability) and
          {M2} (Recorded as cast verifiability) against {Mismatched encryption}.
